# 1/20 Lecture

##### Core characteristics of HCI design

- User-centered: users should be involved through the development of the project 
- Better rather than best: iteration is needed through the core activities 
- Goals-oriented: specific usability and user experience goals need to be identified, clearly documented and agreed at the beginning of the project



##### Usability goals

- Effective to use 
- Efficient to use 
- Safe to use 
- Easy to learn 
- Easy to remember how to use 
- Have good utility



##### User Experience goals

- Desirable aspects 
  - Satisfying     Helpful        Fun 
    Enjoyable     Motivating       Provocative 
    Engaging    Challenging       Surprising 
    Pleasurable     Enhancing sociability   Rewarding 
    Exciting     Supporting creativity     Emotionally fulfilling 
    Entertaining     Cognitively stimulating   Experiencing flow 
- Undesirable aspects 
  - Boring         Unpleasant 
    Frustrating       Patronizing 
    Making one feel guilty  Making one feel stupid 
    Annoying       Cutesy 
    Childish      Gimmicky



##### Design principles (and design patterns)

- Generalizable abstractions for thinking about different aspects of design 
  for design goals 
  - The do’s and don’ts of interface and interaction design in general 
  - Rules of thumb to ensure usability and user experience. 
- Derived from a mix of theory-based knowledge, experience and heuristics 
  - Learned from iterative design process (e.g., user studies, evaluation of prototypes/products) 
  - Learned from expert analysis  (e.g., experienced designers’ heuristics) 
  - Learned from basic disciplines (e.g., psychology, cognitive science, social sciences) 
  - Learned from specific studies of how people use and interact with technologies (e.g., HCI research)



##### Visibility

- This is a control panel for an elevator 

- How does it work? 

- Push a button for the floor you want? 

- Nothing happens. Push any other button? Still nothing. What do you need to do? 

  It is not visible as to what to do!

...you need to insert your room card in the slot by the buttons to get the elevator to work! 

How would you make this action more visible? 

- make the card reader more obvious 
- provide a big label next to the card reader that flashes when someone enters 
- make relevant parts visible 
- provide an auditory message, that says what to do (which language?)



##### Feedback

- Sending information back to the user about what has been done 

- Includes sound, highlighting, animation and combinations of these 

  - e.g. when screen button clicked on provides sound or red highlight 
    feedback:

##### Constraints

- Restricting the possible actions that can be performed 
- Helps prevent user from selecting incorrect options 
- Physical objects can be designed to constrain things 
  - e.g. only one way you can insert a key into a lock



##### Logical or ambiguous design?

- Where do you plug the mouse?  

- Where do you plug the keyboard? 
- top or bottom connector? 
- Do the color coded icons help?



##### How to design them more logically

(i) A provides direct adjacent mapping between icon and connector

(ii) B provides color coding to associate the connectors with the labels

##### Accessibility and inclusiveness

- **Accessibility**: the extent to which an interactive product is accessible by as many people as possible 
  - Focus is on people with disabilities; for instance, those using android OS or apple voiceover
- **Inclusiveness**: making products and services that accommodate the widest possible number of people 
  - For example, smartphones designed for all and made available to everyone regardless of their disability, education, age, or income



##### Disabilities

- Whether someone is disabled changes over time with age, or recovery from an accident
- The severity and impact of an impairment can vary over the course of a day or in different environmental conditions 
- Disabilities can result because technologies are designed to necessitate a certain type of interaction that is impossible for someone with an impairment



##### Being cool about disability

- Prosthetics can be designed to move beyond being functional (and often ugly) to being desirable and fashionable 
- People now refer to “wearing their wheels,” rather than “using a wheelchair”



##### Cultural differences

5/21/2015 versus 21/5/2015? 

- Which should be used for international services and online forms? 
- Why is it that certain products, like smartphones, are universally accepted by people from all parts of the world, whereas people from different cultures react to websites differently?



##### Design Conceptualization

Proof of concept 

- Conceptualize what the proposed product will do 

Why the need to conceptualize design? 

- To scrutinize vague ideas and assumptions about the benefits of the proposed product in terms of their feasibility 
- How realistic is it to develop? 
- How desirable and useful? 
- **Make implicit assumptions and claims explicit.**



##### Assumptions and claims

- Write down your assumptions and claims when coming up with a new design 
- Those that are difficult to articulate  
  - Can highlight what ideas are vague or unrealistic  
  - Identify human activities and interactivities that are problematic  
- Iteratively work out how the design ideas might be improved



##### What is an assumption?

- Taking something for granted when it needs further investigation 
  - For example, people will want to watch TV while driving



##### What is a claim?

- A claim is stating something to be true when it is still open to question 
  - For example, “a multimodal style of interaction for controlling GPS — one that involves speaking while driving — is safe.”



##### How may enabling robot waiters to speak to customers enhance customer experience?

##### What is the problem being addressed?

- The benefits: 

  - The robot could take orders and entertain customers by having a conversation with them  
  - The robot could make recommendations for different customers, such as restless children or fussy eaters  

- But just assumptions 

- The real problem being addressed:  

  “It is difficult to recruit good wait staff who provide the level of customer service to which we have become accustomed.”



##### Working through assumptions

- Many unknowns need to be considered in the initial stages of a design project 
  - Where do your ideas come from?  
  - What sources of inspiration were used?  
  - Is there any theory or research that can be used to inform them? 
- During the early ideation process
  - Ask questions, reconsider assumptions, and articulate concerns



# 2/17 Discussion

Nielsen's Usability Heuristics

##### 1. Visibility of System 

##### 2. Match between system and the real world

- The system should always speak the user's language and follow real-world conventions
- Avoid marketing jargon that might be familiar only to the professionals
- Design components should make sense to the users according to their life experiences
- Tips: use **icons** and other **illustrations** that resonate with the real world

##### 3. User control and freedom

- Do not impose an action on the user or make decisions for them. Give users the freedom to decide
- The system should suggest which paths the users can take and allow users to **undo** and **redo** their actions according to their needs

##### 4. Consistency and standards

- Keep the same language throughout the system to avoid

##### 5. Error prevention

- A good design should always prevent problems from occuring
- Eliminate error-prone conditions, or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action

##### 6. Recognition rather than recall

- Reduce users' cognitive load, and this also includes their memory capacity
- Tips: always leave small reminders of information that can assist users in navigating your designs.

##### 7. Flexibility and efficiency of use

- Your designs should benefit both inexperienced and experienced users
- Provide different flexible process

##### 8. Aesthetic and minimalist design

- Do not consider aesthetics above functions
- Create ineractions that contain only essential information. Avoid unnecessary visual elements that can overwhelm and distract users

##### 9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors

- Your designs should help the user identify and find solutions to eventual probelm and errors
- Show the error

##### 10. Help and Documentation

- Provide documentation to help users understand how to complete their tasks
- Help users understand how to perform their tasks
