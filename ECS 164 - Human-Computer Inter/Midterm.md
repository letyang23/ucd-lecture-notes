## Lecture 1 - What is Human Computer Interaction Design

##### Bad designs

- Elevator controls and labels on the bottom row all look the same, so it is easy to push a label by mistake instead of a control button
- People do not make same mistake for the labels and buttons on the top row. Why not?

##### Why is this vending machine so bad?

- Need to push button first to activate reader
- Normally insert bill first before making selection
- Contravenes well known convention

##### Good design

- Marble answering machine (Bishop, 1995)
- Based on how everyday objects behave
- Easy, intuitive and a pleasure to use
- Only requires one-step actions to perform core tasks

##### Dilemma

- Which is the best way to interact with a smart TV?
  - Standard remote device?
  - Apple slimline remote control?
  -  Voice control using remote or smart speaker

##### What to design

- Need to take into account:
  - Who the users are
  - What activities are being carried out
  - Where the interaction is taking place
- Need to optimize the interactions users have with a product
  - So that they match the users’ activities and needs

##### Understanding users’ needs

- Need to take into account what people are good and bad at
- Consider what might help people in the way they currently do things
- Think through what might provide quality user experiences
- Listen to what people want and get them involved
- Use tried and tested user-centered methods

##### What is (human computer) interaction design?

- Designing interactive **products** to support the way people communicate and interact in their everyday and working lives
  - Sharp, Rogers and Preece (2011)
- The design of (physical, digital or both) **spaces** for human communication and interaction
  - Winograd (1997)

##### UX, User Experience

How a product behaves and is used by people in the real world

- The way people feel about it and their pleasure and satisfaction when using it, looking at it, holding it, and opening or closing it
- “Every product that is used by someone has a user experience: newspapers, ketchup bottles, reclining armchairs, cardigan sweaters.” (Garrett, 2010)
- “All aspects of the end-user's interaction with the company, its services, and its products. (Nielsen and Norman, 2014)

Cannot design a user experience − only can design *for* a user experience

##### Goals of design 

- Develop usable and useful products
  - Usability means easy to learn, effective to use and provide an enjoyable experience 
- Involve users in the design process
  - **HCI’s motto: Designers are not the users.**
  - When we design, we are designers but not users.

##### HCI Design is Interdisciplinary

- Involving concepts, methods, ideas, practices from many different areas
- Different perspectives and ways of seeing and talking about things
- Benefits
  - More ideas and designs generated
- Disadvantages
  - difficult to communicate and progress forward the designs being create



## Lecture 2 - Conceptualizing Interactions

##### Design: Construction of Technology is a Process

- “Design” in the sense of searching for better (but not best) human-machine configuration
- Basically three major stages:
  - Pre-Design Early Stage
  - Design with emphasis on building and implementation
  - Post-Design Late Stage
- We view "Design" not just the artifacts/services constructed, but also as a <u>process</u>.

##### Core characteristics of HCI design

- **User-centered:** users should be involved through the development of the project

- **Better rather than best:** iteration is needed through the core activities

- **Goals-oriented:** specific **usability and user experience goals** need to be identified, clearly documented and agreed at the beginning of the project

##### Usability goals

- Effective to use 
- Efficient to use
- Safe to use
- Easy to learn
- Easy to remember how to use 
- Have good utility

##### User experience goals

- **Desirable aspects**
  - Satisfying / Helpful / Fun / Enjoyable / Motivating / Provocative / Engaging / Challenging / Surprising / Pleasurable / Enhancing sociability / Rewarding / Exciting / Supporting creativity / Emotionally fulfilling / Entertaining / Cognitvely stimulating / Experiencing flow

- **Undesirable aspects**
  - Boring / Unpleasant / Frustrating / Patronizing / Making one feel guilty / Making one feel stupid / Annoying / Cutesy / Childish / Gimmicky

##### How would you design this?

- A digital calendar for family members to use and share

- An online shopping service for sending holiday gifts to other people

##### Design principles (and design patterns)

- Generalizable abstractions for thinking about different aspects of design for design goals
  - The do’s and don’ts of interface and interaction design in general – Rules of thumb to ensure usability and user experience.
- Derived from a mix of theory-based knowledge, experience and heuristics
  - Learned from iterative design process (e.g., user studies, evaluation of prototypes/products)
  - Learned from expert analysis (e.g., experienced designers’ heuristics)
  - Learned from basic disciplines (e.g., psychology, cognitive science, social sciences)
  - Learned from specific studies of how people use and interact with technologies (e.g., HCI research)

##### Visibility

- This is a control panel for an elevator
- How does it work?
- Push a button for the floor you want?
- Nothing happens. Push any other button? Still nothing. What do you need to do?
- It is not visible as to what to do!

... you need to insert your room card in the slot by the buttons to get the elevator to work!

How would you make this action more visible?

- make the card reader more obvious
- provide a big label next to the card reader that flashes when someone enters
- make relevant parts visible
- provide an auditory message, that says what to do (which language?)

##### Feedback

- Sending information back to the user about what has been done

- Includes sound, highlighting, animation and combinations of these
  - e.g. when screen button clicked on provides sound or red highlight feedback

##### Constraints

- Restricting the possible actions that can be performed
- Helps prevent user from selecting incorrect options
- Physical objects can be designed to constrain things
  - e.g. only one way you can insert a key into a lock

##### Logical or ambiguous design?

- Where do you plug the mouse?
- Where do you plug the keyboard?
- top or bottom connector?
- Do the color coded icons help?

##### How to design them more logically

(i) A provides direct adjacent mapping between icon and connector
(ii) B provides color coding to associate the connectors with the labels

##### Accessibility and inclusiveness

- **Accessibility**: the extent to which an interactive product is accessible by as many people as possible
  - Focus is on people with disabilities; for instance, those using android OS or apple voiceover

- **Inclusiveness**: making products and services that accommodate the widest possible number of people
  - For example, smartphones designed for all and made available to everyone regardless of their disability, education, age, or income

##### Disabilities

- Whether someone is disabled changes over time with age, or recovery from an accident
- The severity and impact of an impairment can vary over the course of a day or in different environmental conditions
- Disabilities can result because technologies are designed to necessitate a certain type of interaction that is impossible for someone with an impairment

##### Being cool about disability

- Prosthetics can be designed to move beyond being functional (and often ugly) to being desirable and fashionable
- People now refer to “wearing their wheels,” rather than “using a wheelchair"

##### Cultural differences

5/21/2015 versus 21/5/2015?

- Which should be used for international services and online forms?
- Why is it that certain products, like smartphones, are universally accepted by people from all parts of the world, whereas people from different cultures react to websites differently?

##### Design Conceptualization

Proof of concept

- Conceptualize what the proposed product will do 

Why the need to conceptualize design?

- To scrutinize vague ideas and assumptions about the benefits of the proposed product in terms of their feasibility
- How realistic is it to develop?
- How desirable and useful?
- **Make implicit assumptions and claims explicit.**

##### Assumptions and claims

- Write down your assumptions and claims when coming up with a new design
- Those that are difficult to articulate
  - Can highlight what ideas are vague or unrealistic
  - Identify human activities and interactivities that are problematic

- Iteratively work out how the design ideas might be improved

##### What is an assumption?

- Taking something for granted when it needs further investigation
  - For example, people will want to watch TV while driving

##### What is a claim?

- A claim is stating something to be true when it is still open to question
  - For example, “a multimodal style of interaction for controlling GPS — one that involves speaking while driving — is safe.”

##### Activity: How may enabling robot waiters to speak to customers enhance customer experience?

##### What is the problem being addressed?

- The benefits:
  - The robot could take orders and entertain customers by having a conversation with them
  - The robot could make recommendations for different customers, such as restless children or fussy eaters
- But just assumptions
  - The real problem being addressed:
  - “It is difficult to recruit good wait staff who provide the level of customer service to which we have become accustomed.”

##### Working through assumptions

- Many unknowns need to be considered in the initial stages of a design project
  - Where do your ideas come from?
  - What sources of inspiration were used?
  - Is there any theory or research that can be used to inform them?

- During the early ideation process
  - Ask questions, reconsider assumptions, and articulate concerns

##### A framework for analyzing the problem space

- Are there problems with an existing product or user experience? If so, what are they
- Why do you think there are problems?
- How do you think your proposed design ideas might overcome these
- If you are designing for a new user experience, how do you think your proposed design ideas support, change, or extend current ways of doing things?

##### Activity: What were some possible assumptions and claims about watching 3D TV?

##### Assumptions and claims: how realistic?

- There was no existing problem to overcome
  - What was being proposed was a new way of experiencing TV
- An assumption
  - People would really enjoy the enhanced clarity and color detail provided by 3D
- A claim
  - People would not mind paying more for a new 3D-enabled TV screen because of the new experience

## Lecture 3 - Cognitive Foundation

Overview

- What is cognition?
- What are users good and bad at?
- Describe how cognition has been applied to interaction design
- Explain what Mental Models are

##### Why should we care?

- Interacting with technology often requires “cognition” (seeing, remembering, choosing, responding etc.) although modern interactive systems also depend on other technological and human factors (e.g., social and cultural ones)
- Provides knowledge about what users can and cannot be expected to do cognitively
- Identifies and explains the nature and causes of problems users encounter
- Need to take into account cognitive processes involved and cognitive limitations of users

##### Cognitive processes

- Attention
- Perception
- Memory
- Learning
- Reading, speaking and listening
- Problem-solving, planning, reasoning and decision- making

##### Attention

- **Selecting** things to concentrate on at a point in time from the mass of stimuli around us
- Allows us to **focus** on information that is **relevant** to what we are doing
- Focussed and divided attention enables us to be selective in terms of the mass of competing stimuli but **limits our ability** to keep track of all events
- Information at the interface should be **structured** to capture users’ attention, e.g. use perceptual boundaries (windows), colour, sound and movement

##### Activity: Find the price for a double room at the Quality Inn in Pennsylvania

Tullis (1987) found that the two screens produced quite different results

- Avg. response: 5.5 sec / Avg. response: 3.2 sec, Why?
  - Information is bunced up together, making it hard to search
  - Grouping into vertical categories of information making it easier.

##### Multitasking and attention

- **Polychronicity:** the natural tendency or preference for structuring time. (Capdeferro et al., 2014)
- Is it possible to perform multiple tasks without one or more of them being detrimentally affected?
- Ophir et al. (2009) compared heavy vs light multi-taskers
  - Heavy multi-taskers were more prone to being distracted than those who infrequently multitask
  - heavy multi-taskers are easily distracted and find it difficult to filter irrelevant information

##### Multitasking experiment

- Lotteridge et al. (2015) conducted another study involving writing an essay under two conditions: relevant or irrelevant information
  - Heavy multitaskers were easily distracted but able to put this to good use if the distracting sources were relevant to the task in hand
  - Irrelevant information was found to impact task performance negatively

##### Multitasking at work

It is increasingly common for workers to multitask

- For example, hospital workers have to attend to multiple screens in an operating room that provide new kinds of real-time information
- This requires clinician’s constant attention to check if any data is unusual or anomalous
- Need to develop new attention and scanning strategies

##### Is it OK to use a phone when driving? No!

- Driving is very demanding
- Drivers are prone to being distracted
- There is a significant chance of causing accidents
- Drivers’ reaction times are longer to external events when talking on the phone in a car (Caird et al., 2018) 
- Drivers using their phones rely more on their expectations about what is likely to happen next as conducting a conversation takes up their attention
- Response time is slower to unexpected events (Briggs et al., 2018) 
- Drivers often try to imagine what the other person’s face is like− the person to whom they are speaking 
  - Doing so competes with the processing resources needed to enable them to notice and react to what is in front of them

##### Are hands-free phones safer to use when driving?

- No, as same type of cognitive processing is happening when talking
- The same thing happens when talking with front seat passenger
  - But both can stop in mid-sentence if a hazard is spotted allowing the driver to switch immediately to the road
  - So, it’s less dangerous talking to a front seat passenger than a remote person
  - A remote person on the end of a phone is not privy to what the driver is seeing and will carry on the conversation when there is a hazard
  - This makes it difficult for the driver to switch all their attention to the road

##### Design implications for attention

- Context: Make information salient when it needs to be attended to at a given stage of a task
- Use techniques to achieve this:
  - For example, color, ordering, spacing, underlining, sequencing, and animation
- Avoid cluttering visual interfaces with too much information 
- Consider designing different ways to support effective switching and returning to an interface

##### Perception

- How information is acquired from the world and transformed into experiences
  - A lot of “top-down filtering”
  - people don’t see what has been “seen” and people can see things that are not necessarily there.
- Obvious implication is to design representations that are readily perceivable, e.g.
  - Text should be legible
  - Icons should be easy to distinguish and read

##### Activity

- Weller (2004) found people took less time to locate items for information that was grouped
  - Using a border (2nd screen) compared with using color contrast (1st screen)
- Some argue that too much white space on web pages is detrimental to search process 
  - Makes it hard to find information 
- Do you agree?

##### Design implications

- Icons should enable users to readily distinguish their meaning
- Group information using effective visual ways (e.g. bordering and spacing)
- Sounds should be audible and distinguishable; speech output should enable users to distinguish between the sets of spoken words
- Text should be legible and stand out from the background
- Recognizable tactile feedback should allow users to recognize and distinguish different meanings 

Remember that users can perform “top-down processing”. Usability is important, but there is flexibility for compromise and tradeoff in real-world design.

##### Memory

- Involves first encoding and then retrieving knowledge.
  - For example, recognizing someone’s face or remembering someone’s name
- We don’t remember everything; we filter and process what we attend to.
- Context is important in affecting our memory (i.e. where, when)
- We recognize things much better than being able to recall things
- We remember less about objects we have photographed than when we observe them with the naked eye (Henkel, 2014)

##### Processing in memory

- Encoding is first stage of memory
  - determines which information is attended to in the environment and how it is interpreted
- The more attention paid to something… 
- The more it is processed in terms of thinking about it and comparing it with other knowledge… 
- The more likely it is to be remembered
  - e.g. when learning about HCI, it is much better to reflect upon it, carry out exercises, have discussions with others about it, and write notes than just passively read a book, listen to a lecture or watch a video about it

##### Activity

- Try to remember the dates of your grandparents’ birthday
- Try to remember the color of your grandparents’ car/house
- Which was easiest? Why?
- People are very good at remembering visual cues about things
  - e.g. the color of items, the location of objects and marks on an object 
- They find it more difficult to learn and remember arbitrary material
  - e.g. birthdays and phone

##### Recognition versus recall

- Command-based interfaces require users to recall from memory a name from a possible set of hundreds
- GUIs provide visually-based options that users need only browse through until they recognize one
- Web browsers, etc., provide lists of visited URLs, song titles etc., that support recognition memory 

##### The problem with the classic ‘7 ± 2’

- George Miller’s (1956) theory of how much information people can remember in the short term
- People’s immediate memory capacity is very limited for data of the same kind (e.g. tones varying in pitch, colors varying in lightness)
- Many designers think this is a useful finding for interaction design
- But… 

##### What some designers do… 

- Present only 7 options on a menu
- Display only 7 icons on a tool bar
- Have no more than 7 bullets in a list 
- Place only 7 items on a pull down menu
- Place only 7 tabs on the top of a website page
- But these are wrong. Why? 

##### Why?

- Inappropriate application of the theory
- People can scan lists of bullets, tabs, menu items for the one they want
- They don’t have to recall them from memory having only briefly heard or seen them
- Sometimes a small number of items is good
- But depends on task and available screen estate

##### Digital content management 

- Is a growing problem for many users
  - Vast amounts of data: documents, images, music files, video clips, emails, attachments, bookmarks, etc.,
  - Storage and recall: where and how to save them, how to remember what they were called and where to find them again
  - Mnemonics: naming most common means of encoding them (difficult to remember, especially when content is in the thousands) 

- How might such a process be facilitated taking into account people’s memory abilities?

##### Digital content management

- Memory involves 2 processes
  - recall-directed and recognition-based scanning
- File management systems should be designed to optimize both kinds of memory processes
  - e.g. Search box and history list
- Help users encode files in richer ways
  - Provide them with ways of saving files using colour, flagging, image, flexible text, time stamping, etc. 

##### Is Apple’s Spotlight search tool any good?

##### Memory aids

- SenseCam developed by Microsoft Research Labs (now Autographer)
- A wearable device that intermittently takes photos without any user intervention while worn
- Digital images taken are stored and revisited using special software
- Has been found to improve people’s memory, esp. those suffering from Alzheimers `SenseCam`

#####  Design implications

- Don’t overload users’ memories with complicated procedures for carrying out tasks
- Design interfaces that promote recognition rather than recall
- Provide users with various ways of encoding information to help them remember
  - e.g. categories, color, flagging, time stamping 

##### Mental models

- Users develop an understanding of a system through learning about and using it 
- Knowledge is sometimes described as a mental model:
  - How to use the system (what to do next)
  - What to do with unfamiliar systems or unexpected situations (how the system works)
- People make inferences using mental models of how to carry out tasks 

Mental models

- Craik (1943) described mental models as: 
  - internal constructions of some aspect of the external world enabling predictions to be made
- Involves unconscious and conscious processes
  - images and analogies are activated
- Deep versus shallow models
  - e.g. how to drive a car and how it works 

##### Everyday reasoning and mental models 

- You arrive home on a cold winter’s night to a cold house. How do you get the house to warm up as quickly as possible? Set the thermostat to be at its highest or to the desired temperature?
- You arrive home starving hungry. You look in the fridge and find all that is left is an uncooked pizza. You have an electric oven. Do you warm it up to 375 degrees first and then put it in (as specified by the instructions) or turn the oven up higher to try to warm it up quicker?
- Switch Model
  - "The heater either runs at a constant rate or does not run."
- Accelerator mode
  - "The higher I set the temperature, the faster it heats up."

##### Heating up a room or oven that is thermostat-controlled

- Many people have erroneous mental models (Kempton, 1996) 
- Why?
  - General valve theory, where ‘more is more’ principle is generalised to different settings (e.g. gas pedal, gas cooker, tap, radio volume) 

##### Heating up a room or oven that is thermostat-controlled

- Same is often true for understanding how interactive devices and computers work:
  - poor, often incomplete, easily confusable, based on inappropriate analogies and superstition (Norman, 1983)
  - e.g. elevators and pedestrian crossings - lot of people hit the button at least twice
  - Why? Think it will make the lights change faster or ensure the elevator arrives! 

##### Gulfs of execution and evaluation

- The “gulfs” explicate the gaps that exist between the user and the interface
- The gulf of execution
  - the distance from the user to the physical system
- The gulf of evaluation
  - the distance from the physical system to the user
- Bridging the gulfs can reduce cognitive effort required to perform tasks

##### Bridging the gulfs

- Bridging the gulfs of execution and evaluation

##### Information processing 

- Conceptualizes human performance in metaphorical terms of information processing stages 
- Model Human processor (Card et al, 1983)
  - Models the information processes of a user interacting with a computer 
  - Predicts which cognitive processes are involved when a user interacts with a computer
  - Enables calculations to be made of how long a user will take to carry out a task The human processor model 

##### Limitations

- Based on modelling mental activities that happen exclusively inside the head
- Do not adequately account for how people interact with computers and other devices in real world 

##### Distributed cognition

- Concerned with the nature of cognitive phenomena across individuals, artefacts, and representations (internal & external): Hutchins, 1995
- Describes these in terms of propagation across representational state
- Information is transformed through different media (computers, displays, paper, heads) 

##### How it differs from information processing

- Traditional Model
- Distributed Model

##### What’s involved 

- The distributed problem-solving that takes place
- The role of verbal and non-verbal behaviors
- The various coordinating mechanisms that are used (e.g. rules, procedures)
- The communication that takes place as the collaborative activity progresses
- How knowledge is shared and accessed

##### External cognition

- Concerned with explaining how we interact with external representations (e.g. maps, notes, diagrams) 
- What are the cognitive benefits and what processes involved
- How they extend our cognition 
- What computer-based representations can we develop to help even more? 

Externalizing to reduce memory load

- Diaries, reminders, calendars, notes, shopping lists, to-do lists
  - written to remind us of what to do
- Post-its, piles, marked emails
  - where placed indicates priority of what to do
- External representations:
  - Remind us that we need to do something (e.g. to buy something for mother’s day)
  -  Remind us of what to do (e.g. buy a card) 
  - Remind us when to do something (e.g. send a card by a certain date) 

##### Computational offloading

- When a tool is used in conjunction with an external representation to carry out a computation (e.g. pen and paper)
- Try doing the two sums below (a) in your head, (b) on a piece of paper and c) with a calculator. 
  - 234 x 456 =?? 
  - CCXXXIIII x CCCCXXXXXVI = ?? 
- Which is easiest and why? Both are identical sums 

##### Annotation and cognitive tracing

- Annotation involves modifying existing representations through making marks 
  - e.g. crossing off, ticking, underlining
- Cognitive tracing involves externally manipulating items into different orders or structures 
  - e.g. playing Scrabble, playing cards

##### Design implication 

- Provide external representations at the interface that reduce memory load and facilitate computational offloading 
  - e.g. Information visualizations have been designed to allow people to make sense and rapid decisions about masses of data 

##### Summary 

- Cognition involves several processes including **attention**, **memory**, **perception** and **learning** 
- The way an interface is designed can greatly affect how well users can **perceive**, attend, learn and **remember** how to do their tasks
- Theoretical frameworks, such as **mental models** and external cognition provide ways of understanding how and why people interact with products 
- This can help us think about **how to design** better products

## Lecture 4 - Emotional Design

##### Overview

- Emotions and the user experience
- Models of emotion
  - Ortony et al (2005)
- Emotion recognition and emotional technologies
- Persuasive technologies and behavioral change 
  - how technologies can be designed to change people’s attitudes and behavior
- Anthropomorphism 
  - The pros and cons

#### Recap

- What we have covered so far?
  - Course overview – shared understanding that the class is “project-oriented”, and “process-driven”
  - What is HCI? – “systematic approach for constructing Good Designs (rather than bad ones)”. We’ll continue the exploration on this open-ended question. 
  - Basic ideas and examples of Usability – visibility, feedback, constraints, logical mapping etc. 
  - Cognitive foundation 
    - Interacting with technology is cognitive 
    - Using knowledge of cognitive psychology/science to inform decisions of system and interaction design
    - Useful for identifying good versus bad designscognitive constraints, attention and memory limits.
    - HCI-rooted cognitive framework for describing and modeling interactions – mental model, gulfs of execution and evaluation, distributed cognition etc. 

##### Analyzing this: Why has this simple way of obtaining visitor feedback been so effective? 

- Is it Visibility? Is it Logical Mapping? Is it clever use of Constraints?

##### Pulling at the heart strings with an emotive message

##### Is this form fun to fill in? 

- “My goal was to design Wufoo to feel like something Fisher-Price would make.” - Kevin Hale, Wufoo director 

##### Role of emotions in the user experiences 

- HCI has traditionally been about designing efficient (usable) and effective (useful) systems
- Now more about how to design interactive systems that make people respond in certain ways 
  - For example, to be happy, to be trusting, to learn, or to be motivated 
- Emotional interaction concerns with how we feel and react when interacting with technologies 
- Affective computing is improving with better recognition software and machine learning tools 

Emotional interaction

- What makes us happy, sad, annoyed, anxious, frustrated, motivated, delirious, and so on 
  - Translating this into different aspects of the user experience 
- Why people become emotionally attached to certain products (for instance, virtual pets) 
- Can social robots help reduce loneliness and improve well-being?
- How to change human behavior through the use of emotive feedback  

##### Activity

- Try to remember the emotions you went through when buying a big ticket item online (for example, a brand new laptop, a flight ticket, or a car)
- How many different emotions did you go through? 

##### Ortony et al. (2005) model of emotional design 

##### Three Levels of Emotional Design 

- Don Norman - Emotional Design: Why we love (or hate) everyday things 
  - Visceral level: uncontrolled, automatic, animalistic qualities of human emotion. Ex: fear of fire, visible danger
  - Behavioral level: controlled human actions. Unconscious analysis of situations for quick, effective responses. Ex: finding the easiest solution, shortest path
  - Reflective level: consciousness of thoughts. Learning of concepts and inferences about the world. 
    - https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/norman-s-three-levels-of-design www.id-book.com 

##### Designing with the three levels in mind 

- Visceral design refers to making products look, feel, and sound good 
- Behavioral design is about use, and it equates with traditional values of usability 
- Reflective design is about considering the meaning and personal value of a product 

##### Analyzing a swatch watch design using the three-level model

- Predict (and explain if observed) how it may trigger experiences and emotions? 

- Cultural images and graphical elements designed at the reflective level
- Affordances of use at the behavioral level
- Brilliant colors and wild design attract user’s attention at the visceral level 

##### Visceral design - Look at the two photos - How do you feel about the same pictures, but in different color tone? 

##### Product Example: Forest App to Manage Screen Time 

- https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cc.forestapp&hl=en_US 

#### Other claims from model

- Our emotional state changes how we think 
  - When frightened or angry, we focus narrowly and our bodies respond by tensing muscles and sweating 
  - More likely to be less tolerant
- When happy, we are less focused and our bodies relax 
  - We are more likely to overlook minor problems and be more creative

##### Activity

- Do you feel more creative when you are in a happy mood? Do you get less work done when you are feeling stressed? Reflect about it. 

##### Clippy

- Why was Clippy disliked by so many? 
- Was it annoying, distracting, patronising or other? 
- What sort of user liked Clippy? 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIgHilYzHng www.id-book.com 

##### Expressive interfaces 

- Provide reassuring feedback that can be both informative and fun 
- But can also be intrusive, causing people to get annoyed and even angry 
- Color, icons, sounds, graphical elements and animations are used to make the ‘look and feel’ of an interface appealing 
  - conveys an emotional state 
- In turn this can affect the usability of an interface 
  - people are prepared to put up with certain aspects of an interface (e.g. slow download rate) if the end result is appealing and aesthetic 

##### The appearance of an interface 

(a) Emotional icons were used in the 1980s to indicate rebooting or crashed computer

- Smiling apple face 

(b) Nowadays, computers use more impersonal but aesthetically-pleasing icons to indicate that the user needs to wait 

- Beachball

##### The design of thermostats 

(a) The Nest thermostat has a minimalist and aesthetically-pleasing design 

- Round face and simple dial 
- Large font and numbers 

(b) It is very different from earlier thermostat designs 

- Utilitarian and dull 

Recent Example: Visualizations of Downloading Progress

- Which progress bar feels faster? 

http://www.chrisharrison.net/index.php/Research/ProgressBars2 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDnN3wLY3OE 

##### Friendly interfaces 

- Microsoft pioneered friendly interfaces for technophobes – ‘At home with Bob’ software 
- 3D metaphors based on familiar places (e.g. living rooms) 
- Agents in the guise of pets (e.g. bunny, dog) were included to talk to the user 
  - Make users feel more at ease and comfortable 

##### Frustrating interfaces

- Many causes:
  - When an application doesn’t work properly or crashes 
  - When a system doesn’t do what the user wants it to do 
  - When a user’s expectations are not met 
  - When a system does not provide sufficient information to enable the user to know what to do 
  - When error messages pop up that are vague, obtuse or condemning 
  - When the appearance of an interface is garish, noisy, gimmicky or patronizing 
  - When a system requires users to carry out too many steps to perform a task, only to discover a mistake was made earlier and they need to start all over again

##### Error messages 

- “The application Word Wonder has unexpectedly quit due to a type 2 error.” 

Why not instead: 

- “the application has expectedly quit due to poor coding in the operating system” 

- Ben Shneiderman’s guidelines for error messages include: 
- Avoid using terms like FATAL, INVALID, BAD 
- Audio warnings 
- Avoid UPPERCASE and long code numbers 
- Messages should be precise rather than vague 
- Provide context-sensitive help 

Website error messages 

- 404

##### Should computers say they’re sorry? 

- Discuss in groups for 5 mins 
- Choose your stance – Yes or No 
- Why you think so?  

##### Should computers say they’re sorry?

- Reeves and Naas (1996) argue that computers should be made to apologize 
- Should emulate human responses 
- Would users be as forgiving of computers saying sorry as people are of each other when saying sorry? 
- How sincere would they think the computer was being? For example, after a system crash: 
  - “I’m really sorry I crashed. I’ll try not to do it again” 
- How else should computers communicate with users?

##### Detecting emotions with sensing tech 

- Sensing technologies used to measure facial expressions, gestures, body movement 
- Aim is to predict user’s emotions and aspects of their behavior –
  - E.g. what is someone most likely to buy online when feeling sad, bored or happy 

##### Facial coding using Affdex software 

- https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2851581.2890247 

##### Facial Coding

- Measures a user’s emotions as they interact with a computer or tablet
- Analyses images captured by a webcam of their face 
- Uses this to gauge how engaged the user is when looking at movies, online shopping sites and ads 
- 6 core expressions - sadness, happiness, disgust, fear, surprise and anger 

##### Emotional Recognition & Product Testing

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDC90ObdMEs 

How to use the emotional data? 

- If user screws up their face when an ad pops up -> feel disgust
- “If start smiling -> they are feeling happy “ 
- Website can adapt its ad, movie storyline or content to match user’s emotional state – but do you think this helps? 
- Eye-tracking, finger pulse, speech and words/phrases also analysed when tweeting or posting to Facebook 

Persuasive technologies and behavioral change 

- Interactive computing systems deliberately designed to change people’s attitudes and behaviors (Fogg, 2003) 
- Diverse techniques now used to change what they do or think 
  - Pop-up ads, warning messages, reminders, prompts, personalized messages, recommendations, Amazon 1-click 
  - Commonly referred to as **nudging** 

##### Nintendo’s Pokemon GO Mobile Game 

- As one possible outcome – persuade people to change habits and improving well being 
  - Designed to motivate children to be more physically active on a regular basis
  - Motivate people to explore the physical world while gaming 
  - Do you observe problems and negative side effects? 

##### Which is most effective? 

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lXh2n0aPyw

##### Tracking devices 

- Mobile apps designed to help people monitor and change their behaviour (e.g. fitness, sleeping, weight) 
- Can compare with online leader boards and charts, to show how they have done in relation to their peers and friends 
- Also apps that encourage reflection (i.e., **reflective design**) that in turn increase well-being and happiness 

Anthropomorphism 

- Attributing human-like qualities to inanimate objects (e.g. cars, computers) • Well known phenomenon in advertising
  - Dancing butter, drinks, breakfast cereals 
- Much exploited in human-computer interaction
  - Make user experience more enjoyable, more motivating, make people feel at ease, reduce anxiety 

##### Which do you prefer? 

1. As a welcome message

- “Hello Chris! Nice to see you again. Welcome back. Now what were we doing last time? Oh yes, exercise 5. Let’s start again.” 
- “User 24, commence exercise 5.” 

2. Feedback when get something wrong

- “Now Chris, that’s not right. You can do better than that. Try again.” 
- “Incorrect. Try again.” 

Is there a difference as to what you prefer depending on type of message? Why? 

##### Evidence to support anthropomorphism 

- Reeves and Naas (1996) found that computers that flatter and praise users in education software programs -> positive impact on them 
- “Your question makes an important and useful distinction. Great job!” 
- Students were more willing to continue with exercises with this kind of feedback

##### Criticism of anthropomorphism 

- Deceptive, make people feel anxious, inferior or stupid 
- People tend not to like screen characters that wave their fingers at the user and say: 
  - Now Chris, that’s not right. You can do better than that. Try again.” 
- Many prefer the more impersonal: 
  - “Incorrect. Try again.” 
- Studies have shown that personalized feedback is considered to be less honest and makes users feel less responsible for their actions (e.g. Quintanar, 1982) 

##### Is it OK for seniors to develop an emotional attachment with the robot Zora?

##### Implications 

- Should we create products that adapt according to people’s different emotional states? 
  - When people are feeling angry should an interface be more attentive and informative than when they are happy? 
- Is Norman right? 
  - designers “can get away with more” for products intended to be used during leisure time than those designed for serious tasks

##### Summary 

- Emotional aspects of interaction design concerned with how to facilitate certain states (e.g. pleasure) or avoid reactions (e.g. frustration)
- Well-designed interfaces can elicit good feelings in people 
- Aesthetically pleasing interfaces can be a pleasure to use 
- Expressive interfaces can provide reassuring feedback to users 
- Badly designed interfaces make people frustrated, annoyed, or angry 
- Emotional technologies can be designed to persuade people to change their behaviors or attitudes 
- Anthropomorphism is the attribution of human qualities to objects 
- Virtual agents and robot pets have been developed to make people feel motivated, reassured, and in a good mood

## Lecture - A Brief Introduction to Personas

**User** Interface Design
**User** Centered Design
**User** Friendly
**Human** Computer Interaction...

*focused on the user* *vs* *system*

**But who, exactly, is this user?**

##### The Elastic User

- Can mean everyone and thus no one 
  - vague audience means unfocussed design 
  - design defines user after the fact 
  - lack of specifics means its easy to rationalize any design 

##### The Elastic User (defined after the fact) 

- An expert who wants plentiful options

##### The Elastic User (self-referential) 

- The user is me (even if he or she isn’t)

##### Example 

G4K Company 

- Produces children’s educational and game software 
- Goal: make a corporate destination site for kids 
  - child-oriented entertainment 
  - news 
  - merchandise related to G4K software

##### The Elastic User 

I’ll gladly surf to your web site 

I will love using it 

I will buy your stuff 

I’ll spend hours navigating your pages 

I know how to download software 

I have a credit card so I can pay 

I am totally nto action games

 I like dolls 

Parents? What parents? …

##### Making the User Real 

do they have computers? 

how do they use them? 

what do they know? 

what are their interests? 

do they use the web? 

what do they like doing online? 

… 

Captured as **Personas**

##### Making the User Real 

User research 

- gather data about intended audience 

How? 

- stakeholder interviews 
  - business and technical context surrounding the product 
  - preliminary product vision 
  - budget and schedule o technical constraints and opportunities 
  - business driers 
  - stakeholders’ perception of the user 
  - … 
- customer interviews (customer may not be the user!) 
  - goals in purchasing the product 
  - frustrations with current solutions 
  - decision process for purchasing intended product 
  - role in product installation, maintenance, and management 
  - domain-related issues and vocabulary
  -  … 
- user interviews
  - context of how product (or analogous system) fits in their lives or workflow
  - their domain knowledge for this activity 
  - current tasks and activities: that the product is and isn’t supposed to support
  - goals and motivations for using this product o problems and frustrations with current products
  - … 
- user observations 
  - non-obtrusive capture of specific activities
  - how they get things done 
- field studies 
  - capture broader activities 
  - how activities fit together in their ecosystem 
- contextual inquiry 
  - master/apprentice model of learning 
  - observing and asking questions 
- … 

Issues? 

- rich data, but 
  - un-integrated 
  - needs to be interpreted 
  - high learning curve to assimilate 
  - too much for ‘casual’ team members to use 
  - easy to forget over long project
  - easy to forget big picture 

Personas

- a surrogate 
- based on research 
- pseudo-fictional character representing a user archetype 
- a composite 
- concrete descriptive model of intended user 
- as a set, explores ranges of archetypes and behaviours 

##### Personas

Why? 

- Precise way of thinking about 
  - how users behave 
  - their motivations o how they think o what they wish to accomplish (goals) 
  - why they want to do what they do
- Within the team
  - provides a shared understanding 
  - engage in empathy of design towards a target user 
  - helps communicate who you are building the product for 
  - helps determines what the product should and shouldn’t do 
  - serves as a stable reference point during the design process 
  - provides focus 
  - a stand-in for actual users 
  - testable via walkthroughs 

Characteristics 

- based on research 
- archetypes represented as individual people 
- not a real person, but a composite archetype 
  - each represents groups of users

As a set 

- explores ranges of archetypes and behaviours 

Basic structure

- specific narrative 
- describes a specific usage pattern 
- embodied in a specific fictional user 
- by means of text and images 
- and based on data 

Includes 

- name 
- photo 
- **goals** 

and a mix of 

- key characteristics 
- motivations 
- context 
- activities 
- narrative story 
- representative quotes 
- pain points…

You now know 

1. The Elastic User is problematic 
2. Good Design requires Making the User Real
3. Personas define ‘real’ Archetype Users

## Lecture 5 - Interface Types

##### Lecture: Interface Type

- Interface types 
  - highlight the main design and research issues for each of the different interfaces 
- Consider which interface is best for a given activity and/or need.

##### 20 interface types covered (in the textbook) 

1. Command 
2. Graphical 
3. Multimedia 
4. Virtual reality 
6. Web
7. Mobile
8. Appliance 
9. Voice 
10. Pen
11. Touch
12. Gesture
13. Haptic
14. Multimodal
15. Shareable
16. Tangible
17. Augmented Reality
18. Wearables
19. Robots and drones
20. Brain–computer interaction
21. Smart 

 ##### 1. Command line interfaces 

- Commands such as abbreviations (for instance, ls) typed in at the prompt to which the system responds (for example, by listing current files) 
- Some are hard wired at keyboard, while others can be assigned to keys 
- Efficient, precise, and fast 
- Large overhead to learning set of commands

Second Life command line-based interface for visually-impaired users 

 ##### 2. WIMP and GUI 

- Xerox Star first WIMP -> rise to GUIs 
- Windows – could be scrolled, stretched, overlapped, opened, closed, and moved around the screen using the mouse 
- Icons – represented applications, objects, commands, and tools that were opened when clicked on 
- Menus – offering lists of options that could be scrolled through and selected 
- Pointing device – a mouse controlling the cursor as a point of entry to the windows, menus, and icons on the screen 

Apple’s shrinking windows

Simple smartwatch menus with 1, 2, or 3 options 

##### Windows 

- Windows were invented to overcome physical constraints of a computer display
  - enable more information to be viewed and tasks to be performed 
- Scroll bars within windows also enable more information to be viewed 
- Multiple windows can make it difficult to find desired one 
  - listing, iconising, shrinking are techniques that help 

##### GUIs 

- Same basic building blocks as WIMPs but more varied 
  - Color, 3D, sound, animation (new generation – AR/ VR) 
  - Many types of menus, icons, windows 
- New graphical elements, e.g. 
  - toolbars, docks, rollovers 
- Challenge now is to design GUIs that are best suited for tablet, smartphone and smartwatch interfaces 

Selecting a country from a scrolling window 

Is this method any better? 

##### Research and design issues 

- Window management 
  - enables users to move fluidly between different windows (and monitors) 
  - How to switch attention between windows without getting distracted 
  - Design principles of spacing, grouping, and simplicity should be used 

##### Menus 

- A number of menu interface styles 
  - flat lists, drop-down, pop-up, contextual, and expanding ones, e.g., scrolling and cascading
- Flat menus 
  - good at displaying a small number of options at the same time and where the size of the display is small, e.g. iPods, smartphones 
  - but have to nest the lists of options within each other, requiring several steps to get to the list with the desired option 
  - moving through previous screens can be tedious

##### Expanding menus 

- Enables more options to be shown on a single screen than is possible with a single flat menu 
- More flexible navigation, allowing for selection of options to be done in the same window 
- Most popular are cascading ones 
  - primary, secondary and even tertiary menus 
  - downside is that they require precise mouse control 
  - can result in overshooting or selecting wrong options 

Cascading menu

##### Contextual menus 

- Provide access to often-used commands that make sense in the context of a current task 
- Appear when the user presses the Control key while clicking on an interface element 
  - e.g., clicking on a photo in a website together with holding down the Control key results in options ‘open it in a new window,’ ‘save it,’ or ‘copy it’ 
- Helps overcome some of the navigation problems associated with cascading menus

##### Icon design 

- Icons are assumed to be easier to learn and remember than commands 
- Can be designed to be compact and variably positioned on a screen 
- Now pervasive in every interface – e.g. represent desktop objects, tools (e.g. paintbrush), applications (e.g. web browser), and operations (e.g. cut, paste, next, accept, change) 

##### Icon Representation forms 

- The mapping between the representation and underlying referent can be: 
  - **similar** (e.g., a picture of a file to represent the object file) 
  - **analogical** (e.g., a picture of a pair of scissors to represent ‘cut) 
  - **arbitrary** (e.g., the use of an X to represent ‘delete’) 
- Most effective icons are similar ones 
- Many operations are actions making it more difficult to represent them 
  - use a combination of objects and symbols that capture the salient part of an action 

Early icons 

Newer icons 

Simple flat 2D icons 

##### Basic Icons on Phones 

- Which is which? 
- Are they easy to understand 
- Are they distinguishable? 
- What representation forms are used? 
- Analyse it using HCI concepts and principles

Discuss for 3 mins. Find one good design and one not-so-good design

##### Research and design issues 

- There is a wealth of resources now so do not have to draw or invent new icons from scratch 
  - guidelines, style guides, icon builders, libraries 
- Text labels can be used alongside icons to help identification for small icon sets 
- For large icon sets (e.g. photo editing or word processing) use rollovers 

##### 4. Virtual reality 

- Computer-generated graphical simulations providing: 
  - “the illusion of participation in a synthetic environment rather than external observation of such an environment” (Gigante, 1993) 
- Provide new kinds of experience, enabling users to interact with objects and navigate in 3D space 
- Create highly engaging user experiences 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC_nhzSdNvo www.id-book.com 

##### Pros and cons

- Can have a higher level of fidelity with objects they represent compared to multimedia 
- Induces a sense of presence where someone is totally engrossed by the experience
  - “a state of consciousness, the (psychological) sense of being in the virtual environment” (Slater and Wilbur, 1999) 
- Provides different viewpoints: 1st and 3rd person 
- Head-mounted displays are uncomfortable to wear, and can cause motion sickness and disorientation 
- Compatibility issues with other forms of interaction: Browsing websites in VR? Using VR in social events? 

##### Research and design issues 

- Much research on how to design safe and realistic VRs to facilitate training 
  - e.g. flying simulators 
  - help people overcome phobias (e.g. spiders, talking in public) 
- Design issues 
  - how best to navigate through them (e.g. first versus third person) 
  - how to control interactions and movements (e.g. use of head and body movements) 
  - how best to interact with information (e.g. use of keypads, pointing, joystick buttons); 
  - level of realism to aim for to engender a sense of presence 

##### 5. Information visualization and dashboards 

- Computer-generated interactive graphics of complex data 
- Amplify human cognition, enabling users to see patterns, trends, and anomalies in the visualization (Card et al, 1999) 
- Aim is to enhance discovery, decision-making, and explanation of phenomena

##### Dashboards 

- Show screenshots of data updated over periods of time 
- to be read at a glance 
- Usually not interactive - slices of data that depict current state of a system or process 
- Need to provide digestible and legible information for users 
  - design its spatial layout so intuitive to read when first looking at it 
  - should also direct a user’s attention to anomalies or unexpected deviations 

Which dashboard is best? (A) 

Which dashboard is best? (B) 

 ##### 6. Web 

- Early websites were largely text-based, providing hyperlinks 
- Concern was with how best to structure information to enable users to navigate and access it easily and quickly 
- Nowadays, more emphasis on making pages distinctive, striking, and pleasurable 
- Need to think of how to design information for multiplatforms - keyboard or touch? 
  - e.g. smartphones, tablets, PCs 

 ##### 8. Mobile 

- Handheld devices intended to be used while on the move 
- Have become pervasive, increasingly used in all aspects of everyday and working life 
- Apps running on mobiles have greatly expanded, e.g. 
  - used in restaurants to take orders 
  - car rentals to check in car returns 
  - supermarkets for checking stock
  - in the streets for multi-user gaming
  - in education to support life-long learning 

##### The advent of the iPhone app 

- A whole new user experience that was designed primarily for people to enjoy 
  - many apps not designed for any need, want or use but purely for idle moments to have some fun 
  - e.g. iBeer developed by magician Steve Sheraton 
  - ingenious use of the accelerometer that is inside the phone

QR codes and cell phones 

iBeer app

##### Mobile challenges 

- Smaller screens, small number of physical keys and restricted number of controls 
- Innovative physical designs including: 
  - roller wheels, rocker dials, up/down ‘lips’ on the face of phones, 2-way and 4-way directional keypads, softkeys, silk-screened buttons 
- Usability and preference varies 
  - depends on the users’ constraint and context 
- Smartphones overcome mobile physical constraints through using multi-touch displays

##### Research and design issues 

- Mobile interfaces can be tricky and cumbersome to use for those with poor manual dexterity or ‘fat’ fingers 
- Key concern is hit area 
  - area on the phone display that the user touches to make something happen, such as a key, an icon, a button or an app 
  - space needs to be big enough for fat fingers to accurately press 
  - if too small the user may accidentally press the wrong key

##### 9.  Speech 

- Where a person talks with a system that has a spoken language application, e.g. timetable, travel planner 
- Used most for inquiring about very specific information, e.g. flight times or to perform a transaction, e.g. buy a ticket 
- Also used by people with disabilities 
  - – e.g. speech recognition word processors, page scanners, web readers, home control systems 

Have speech interfaces come of age? 

##### Get me a human operator! 

- Most popular use of speech interfaces previously was for call routing 
- Caller-led speech where users state their needs in their own words 
  - e.g. “I’m having problems with my voice mail” 
- Idea is they are automatically forwarded to the appropriate service 
- What is your experience of speech systems? 

##### Format 

- Directed dialogs are where the system is in control of the conversation 
- Ask specific questions and require specific responses 
- More flexible systems allow the user to take the initiative: 
  - e.g. “I’d like to go to Paris next Monday for two weeks.” 
- More chance of error, since caller might assume that the system is like a human 
- Guided prompts can help callers back on track 
  - e.g. “Sorry I did not get all that. Did you say you wanted to fly next Monday?” 

##### Research and design issues 

- How to design systems that can keep conversation on track 
  - help people navigate efficiently through a menu system 
  - enable them to easily recover from errors 
  - guide those who are vague or ambiguous in their requests for information or services 
- Type of voice actor (e.g. male, female, neutral, or dialect) 
  - do people prefer to listen to and are more patient with a female or male voice, a northern or southern accent?

##### 11.  Touch 

- Touch screens, such as walk-up kiosks, detect the presence and location of a person’s touch on the display
- Multi-touch support a range of more dynamic finger tip actions, e.g. swiping, flicking, pinching, pushing and tapping 
- Now used for many kinds of displays, such as Smartphones, iPods, tablets and tabletops 

##### Research and design issues 

- **Direct Manipulation**: More fluid and direct styles of interaction involving freehand and pen-based gestures 
- Core design concerns include whether size, orientation, and shape of touch displays effect collaboration 
- Much faster to scroll through wheels, carousels and bars of thumbnail images or lists of options by finger flicking 
- More cumbersome, error-prone and slower to type using a virtual keyboard on a touch display than using a physical keyboard 
- Will finger-flicking, swiping, stroking and touching a screen result in new ways of consuming, reading, creating and searching digital content? 

##### 12. Air-based gestures 

- Uses camera recognition, sensor and computer vision techniques 
  - can recognize people’s body, arm and hand gestures in a room 
  - systems include Kinect 
- Movements are mapped onto a variety of gaming motions, such as swinging, bowling, hitting and punching 
- Players represented on the screen as avatars doing same actions 

Home entertainment 

- Universal appeal 
  - young children, grandparents, professional gamers, technophobes 

##### 13. Haptic 

- Tactile feedback 
  - applying vibration and forces to a person’s body, using actuators that are embedded in their clothing or a device they are carrying, such as a smartphone 
- Can enrich user experience or nudge them to correct error 
- Can also be used to simulate the sense of touch between remote people who want to communicate 

##### Realtime vibrotactile feedback 

- Provides nudges when playing incorrectly 
- Uses motion capture 
- Nudges are vibrations on arms and hands 

##### Research and design issues 

- Where best to place actuators on body 
- Whether to use single or sequence of ‘touches’ 
- When to buzz and how intense 
- How does the wearer feel it in different contexts? 
- What kind of new smartphones/smart-watches apps can use vibrotactile creatively? 
  - e.g. slow tapping to feel like water dropping that is meant to indicate it is about to rain and heavy tapping to indicate a thunderstorm is looming 

##### 14. Multi-modal 
- Meant to provide enriched and complex user experiences 
  - multiplying how information is experienced and detected using different modalities, i.e. touch, sight, sound, speech 
  - support more flexible, efficient, and expressive means of human–computer interaction 
  - Most common is speech and vision 

Research and design issues 

- Need to recognize and analyse speech, gesture, and eye gaze 
- What is gained from combining different input and outputs 
- Is talking and gesturing, as humans do with other humans, a natural way of interacting with a computer?

##### 15. Shareable 

- Shareable interfaces are designed for more than one person to use 
  - provide multiple inputs and sometimes allow simultaneous input by co-located groups 
  - large wall displays where people use their own pens or gestures 
  - interactive tabletops where small groups interact with information using their fingertips 
  - e.g. DiamondTouch, Smart Table and Surface 

A smartboard

DiamondTouch Tabletop

 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giDF9lKhCLc

##### Advantages 

- Provide a large interactional space that can support flexible group working 
- Can be used by multiple users 
  - Can point to and touch information being displayed 
  - Simultaneously view the interactions and have same shared point of reference as others 
- Can support more equitable participation compared with groups using single PC 

##### Research and design issues 

-  More fluid and direct styles of interaction involving freehand and pen-based gestures 
- Core design concerns include whether size, orientation, and shape of the display have an effect on collaboration 
- Horizontal surfaces compared with vertical ones support more turn-taking and collaborative working in co-located groups 
- Providing larger-sized tabletops does not improve group working but encourages more division of labor

##### 17. Augmented and mixed reality 

- Augmented reality - virtual representations are superimposed on physical devices and objects 
- Mixed reality - views of the real world are combined with views of a virtual environment 
- Many applications including medicine, games, flying, and everyday exploring 

##### Examples 

- In medicine 
  - virtual objects, e.g. X-rays and scans, are overlaid on part of a patient’s body 
  - aid the physician’s understanding of what is being examined or operated 
- In air traffic control 
  - dynamic information about aircraft overlaid on a video screen showing the real planes, etc. landing, taking off, and taxiing 
  - Helps identify planes difficult to make out 

An augmented map 

##### Museum Guidance in AR 

- Appears as a 3D character to act as personal tour guide at Science Museum 

##### Research and design issues 

- What kind of digital augmentation? 
  - When and where in physical environment? 
  - Needs to stand out but not distract from ongoing task
  - Need to be able to align with real world objects 
- What kind of device? 
  - Smartphone, head up display or other? 

##### 18. Wearables 

- First developments were head- and eyewear-mounted cameras that enabled user to record what was seen and to access digital information 
- Since, jewellery, head-mounted caps, smart fabrics, glasses, shoes, and jackets have all been used 
  - provide the user with a means of interacting with digital information while on the move 
- Applications include automatic diaries, tour guides, cycle indicators and fashion clothing

Google Glass: short-lived 

- What were the pros and cons? 

##### Research and design issues 

- Comfort 
  - needs to be light, small, not get in the way, fashionable, and preferably hidden in the clothing 
  - Hygiene – is it possible to wash or clean the clothing once worn? 
  - Ease of wear – how easy is it to remove the electronic gadgetry and replace it? 
  - Usability – how does the user control the devices that are embedded in the clothing?

##### 19. Robots and drones 

- Four types of robot 
  - remote robots used in hazardous settings 
  - domestic robots helping around the house 
  - pet robots as human companions 
  - sociable robots that work collaboratively with humans, and communicate and socialize with them – as if they were our peers

##### Advantages 

- Pet robots are assumed to have therapeutic qualities, helping to reduce stress and loneliness 
- Remote robots can be controlled to investigate bombs and other dangerous materials 

##### Drones 

- Unmanned aircraft that are controlled remotely and used in a number of contexts 
  - e.g. entertainment, such as carrying drinks and food to people at festivals and parties; 
  - agricultural applications, such as flying them over vineyards and fields to collect data that is useful to farmers 
  - helping to track poachers in wildlife parks in Africa 
- Can fly low and and stream photos to a ground station, where images can be stitched together into maps 
- Can be used to determine the health of a crop or when it is the best time to harvest the crop 

Drone in vineyard

##### Research and design issues 

- How do humans react to physical robots designed to exhibit behaviors (e.g. making facial expressions) compared with virtual ones? 
- Should robots be designed to be human-like or look like and behave like robots that serve a clearly defined purpose? 
- Should the interaction be designed to enable people to interact with the robot as if it was another human being or more human-computer-like (e.g. pressing buttons to issue commands)? 
- Is it acceptable to use unmanned drones to take a series of images or videos of fields, towns, and private property without permission or people knowing what is happening? 

##### 20. Brain-computer interfaces 

- Brain–computer interfaces (BCI) provide a communication pathway between a person’s brain waves and an external device, such as a cursor on a screen 
- Person is trained to concentrate on the task, e.g. moving the cursor 
- BCIs work through detecting changes in the neural functioning in the brain 
- BCIs apps: 
  - Games 
  - enable people who are paralysed to control robots 

Brainball game

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnEyL9J9yag www.id-book.com 

##### Which interface? 

- Is multimedia better than tangible interfaces for learning? 
- Is speech as effective as a command-based interface? 
- Is a multimodal interface more effective than a monomodal interface? 
- Will wearable interfaces be better than mobile interfaces for helping people find information in foreign cities? 
- Are virtual environments the ultimate interface for playing games? 
- Will shareable interfaces be better at supporting communication and collaboration compared with using networked desktop PCs? 

##### Which interface? 

- Will depend on task, users, context, cost, robustness, etc. 
- Mobile platforms taking over from PCs 
- Speech interfaces also being used much more for a variety of commercial services 
- Appliance and vehicle interfaces becoming more important 
- Shareable and tangible interfaces entering our homes, schools, public places, and workplaces 

##### Discussion Activity 

- Discuss in groups about the specific Interface Types you’d like to try out for your final project 
  - Pick three, rank them 
  - What’s the topic and goal of your project? 
  - Which interface type appears to work the best for your purpose/application. Why
  - How about implementation? Is it challenging as you know? What’s your plan for prototyping? 
- Discuss for 15 minutes, and we’ll find groups to share.

##### Summary 

- Many innovative interfaces have emerged post the WIMP/GUI era, including speech, wearable, mobile, brain and tangible 
- Raises many design and research questions to decide which to use 
- e.g. how best to represent information to the user so they can carry out ongoing activity or task 
- New interfaces that are context-aware or monitor raise ethical issues concerned with what data is being collected and what it is used for
