### Homework 4

1. For any $n \in \mathbb{Z}_+$ and any set $A$ satisfying $|A| = n$, $|P(A)| = 2^n$

   **Proof:** 

   1. When $n=1, |A|=1.$

      Then $|P(A)| = \{\empty, A\}$

      --->$|P(A)|$ = 2

   2. Suppose $|A| = k=>|P(A)|=2^k$

      We want to prove that 

      $|A| = k+1 =>|P(A)| = 2^k+1$
