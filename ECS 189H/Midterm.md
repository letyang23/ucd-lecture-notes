# Week 1: Research Method

### What is Research?

Research is defined as:

1. A careful or diligent search (literature review, research!)
2. The collection of information about a particular subject (data collection!)
3. A studious inquiry or examination; especially an investigation or experimentation aimed at the discovery and interpretation of facts, revision of accepted theories or laws in light of new facts, or the practical application of such new or revised theories or laws.

To evaluate interactive systems through research, we add "relevant to phenomena surrounding humans interacting with computers."

### What is Empirical?

The term "Empirical Research" refers to research that is:

1. Originating in or based on observation or experience.
2. Capable of being verified or disproved by observation or experiment.

### How do we conduct Empirical Research?

We conduct empirical research through:

- A program of inquiry conforming to the scientific method.

The scientific method is defined as the principles and procedures for the systematic pursuit of knowledge involving the recognition and formulation of a problem, the collection of data through observation and experiment, and the formulation and testing of hypotheses.

### Why do Empirical Research?

We conduct empirical research to:

- Answer (and raise!) questions about new or existing HCI designs and/or systems.
- Transform baseless opinions into informed opinions supported by evidence.
- Develop or explore models that describe or predict behavior (of humans interacting with computers).
