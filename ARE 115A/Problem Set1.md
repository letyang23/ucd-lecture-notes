To compare the level of development using GDP and GDP per capita between two countries, we need to make sure GDP in both countries is converted into a common currency, usually the US$. 

One option to make this conversion is to use the official exchange rate2. For example, using the official exchange rate, the GDP per capita of Indonesia and the USA was $4,136 and $65,118 in 2019, respectively. Can we say that Americans were 15.8 times richer than Indonesians in 2019? Not so fast! In this problem, we will see the importance of accounting for price differences between two countries to account for the real purchasing power of income in each country. The PPP exchange rate accounts for differences in relative prices and thus provides a better measure to compare living standards across countries.
Table 4.1 contains rice, restaurant meal (for one person) and an iPhone price information as well as expenditure shares for three countries. Assume the expenditure shares shown are the same in all countries.
