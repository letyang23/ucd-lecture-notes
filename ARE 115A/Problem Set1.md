To compare the level of development using GDP and GDP per capita between two countries, we need to make sure GDP in both countries is converted into a common currency, usually the US$. 

One option to make this conversion is to use the official exchange rate2. For example, using the official exchange rate, the GDP per capita of Indonesia and the USA was $4,136 and $65,118 in 2019, respectively. Can we say that Americans were 15.8 times richer than Indonesians in 2019? Not so fast! In this problem, we will see the importance of accounting for price differences between two countries to account for the real purchasing power of income in each country. The PPP exchange rate accounts for differences in relative prices and thus provides a better measure to compare living standards across countries.
Table 4.1 contains rice, restaurant meal (for one person) and an iPhone price information as well as expenditure shares for three countries. Assume the expenditure shares shown are the same in all countries.

d. This policy is directed to help only those households that were poor in 2004 (nothing changes for 1993). Let's see how the policy affected the two types of poor households in 2004: i) the Chronic Poor and ii) the Transitory Poor (TP) who fell into poverty in 2004. To do so, use the information from Tables 3B and 4 to fill in Table 5 below. Report the NUMBER (not percentage) of households in the different dynamic poverty classifications without the policy (column 2) and with the policy (column 3). In Column 4, you will then calculate the percentage change in the number of Chronic Poor and the number of Transitory Poor who fell into poverty as a result of the policy.

Please write your answers in percentages using one decimal point. (For example: if your answer is 24.0256 you will enter 24.0% or 67.786 you will write 67.8%.)
