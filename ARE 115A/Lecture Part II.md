- Midterm answer on Canvas/File/Midterm. Results in next week
- Problem Set 3 available on Tuesday 5/16, due Thursday 5/25

#### Summary and Moving Forward

- Discount Rate (How willing am I to put off earning higher income?)
- Risk aversion (How willing am I to take on the risk associated with this investment?)
- Credit access (am I ABLE to make this investment?)

### Maize

- Yield gap between China and Mozambique (Major consumer in Maize)

##### Ana and Zimba's family in rural areas Mozambique

- Income: $2.25/day
- Minimum assets/wealth
  - 2 hectares of land (5 acres)
  - 1 cow, 10 goats, 22 chickens
  - Most of their income is from agriculture.
    - Most year they grow maize to feed the family and sell the leftovers.

- **Local** varieties of maize: 500 kg/hectare
- **Hybrid** varieties: can be as high as 400 kg/hectare

Why they plant in local instead of hybrid maize?

1. No access to credit
   - Hybrid maize cost more than local maize
2. No access to insurance
   - If there is drought that hybrid varieties can't stand, there is gonna be big trouble.
3. No information about the new technology

### Two financial markets

- Credit Market
- Insurance Market

### Financial Inclusion around the world

- WB & G20 Financial Inclusion Indicators

- False. Not "actions", it's characteristics or types of borrowers.



### Credit: Three Crucial Roles

1. Credit allows you to get ahead
   - techniques allows you to invest
2. Credit prevents you from falling behind
   -   Credit for consumption after **shock**
3. Credits shifts risks
   - Default clauses (liability rules)
   - Shifts risk from borrower to lenders

#### What does this mean for the family

- Credit would allow them to make key investment.
  - Intensify farm production: more fertilizer, better seeds
  - Plant more profitable cash crops
  - Invest in kids: send older kids to better school. Buy computer for the family
- Credit can be used to protect consumption after a **shock**.
  - Without credit
    - Drought caused loss of harvest
    - meals reduce from 3 to 2
    - Kids pulled out from school

### Basic economics says...

Markets would be great if the market hits the equilibrium.

A competitive market equilibrium if a bunch of conditions hold:

- No externalities
- No public goods
- **No asymmetric information** (we are going to focus on this one)

Asymetric information



# 05-16 Lecture

(start from 1:01:30)

### Types of Potential Borrowers

- Lender knows that two types of potential borrowers exist:
  - SAFE type (high quality)
  - RISKY type (low quality)
- If lender knows
  - SAFE type, LOW interest rate
  - RISKY type, HIGH interest rate

###  But under Asymmetric Information

- Lenders CANNOT distinguish between safe and risky types.
- Lender will end up having two choices for the interest rate:
  - 1. Set it low enough so that BOTH types will want the loan
    2. Give up on SAFE type and set it high, deal only with RISKY types

###  General Strategy

E(ys): Expected income for Safe Type of borrower

E(yR): Expected income for Risky Type of borrower

$E(\pi _S)$: Expected profit of lender on a loan to a Safe Type of borrower

$E(\pi _R)$: Expected profit of lender on a loan to a Risky Type of borrower

### Example

##### Entreprenuers

- Two Types of Entrepreneurs
  - Both have $0 savings
  - Both need $100 loan
  - Both want to maximize E(y)
  - Both must earn E(y) >= 0
- Half are Safe Types
  - Revenue = 180 with prob 1 (always succeed)
- Half are Risky Types
  - Revenue = 260 with probability of 0.5 (success)
  - Revenue = 0 with probablity of 0.5 (fail)

#####  Lender

- Want to maximize $E(\pi)$
- Opportunity Cost: 100*(1+0.1) = 110

- Offers **limited Liability** loans
  - Borrower doesn't have to repay **anything** if project fails
- Must earn $E(\pi)\ge 0$

##### Borrowers' Expected Income as a Function of i

- Expected Income of Safe Type $E(y_S)$
  - $E(y_s) = 1*[180-100*(1+i)]$
  - $E(y_S) = 80-100i$
- Expected Income of Risky Type
  - $E(y_R) = 0.5[260-100(1+i)] + 0.5*[0-0]$
  - $E(y_R) = 80-50i$

##### Lender's Expected Profit as a Function of i

- Lender's Expected Profit on loan to Safe Type:
  - $E(\pi_S) = 1*[100(1+i) - 100*(1+0.1)]$
  - $E(\pi_S) = -10+100i$
- Lender's Expected Profit on loan to Risky type:
  - $E(\pi_S) = 0.5[100(1+i)-100(1+0.1)] + 0.5[0-100(1+0.1)]$
  - $E(\pi_S) = -60+50i$
