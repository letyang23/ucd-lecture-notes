### Maize

- Yield gap between China and Mozambique (Major consumer in Maize)

##### Ana and Zimba's family in rural areas Mozambique

- Income: $2.25/day
- Minimum assets/wealth
  - 2 hectares of land (5 acres)
  - 1 cow, 10 goats, 22 chickens
  - Most of their income is from agriculture.
    - Most year they grow maize to feed the family and sell the leftovers.

- **Local** varieties of maize: 500 kg/hectare
- **Hybrid** varieties: can be as high as 400 kg/hectare

Why they plant in local instead of hybrid maize?

1. No access to credit
   - Hybrid maize cost more than local maize
2. No access to insurance
   - If there is drought that hybrid varieties can't stand, there is gonna be big trouble.
3. No information about the new technology

### Two financial markets

- Credit Market
- Insurance Market

- False. Not "actions", it's characteristics or types of borrowers.



### Credit: Three Crucial Roles

1. Credit allows you to get ahead
   - techniques allows you to invest
2. Credit prevents you from falling behind
   -   Credit for consumption after **shock**
3. Credits shifts risks
   - Default clauses (liability rules)
   - Shifts risk from borrower to lenders

#### What does this mean for the family

- Credit would allow them to make key investment.
  - Intensify farm production: more fertilizer, better seeds
  - Plant more profitable cash crops
  - Invest in kids: send older kids to better school. Buy computer for the family
- Credit can be used to protect consumption after a **shock**.
  - Without credit
    - Drought caused loss of harvest
    - meals reduce from 3 to 2
    - Kids pulled out from school

### Basic economics says...

Markets would be great if the market hits the equilibrium.

A competitive market equilibrium if a bunch of conditions hold:

- No externalities
- No public goods
- **No asymmetric information** (we are going to focus on this one)

Asymetric information
