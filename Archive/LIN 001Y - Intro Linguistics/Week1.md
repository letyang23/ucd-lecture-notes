### What is Linguistics

- Writing is more pure than speech -True or False?
  - **FALSE**-this is a myth
  - We will learn that written and spoken/signed language are different – one is not more “pure” than the other. 
  - Linguists generally focus on spoken/signed language as an object of study and that is what we will focus on in this class

- *Nobody ain't done nothin* is bad English –True or False?
  - This is a myth - **FALSE**
  - What speakers do naturally is what makes language so interesting to study. 
  - In Linguistics, we do not give value judgments to language varieties.

- Slang, vernacular, or non-standard usage, degrade a language – True or False?
  - This is a myth - **FALSE**
  - Slang and non-standard usage is considered linguistic innovation. Language change and evolution is considered a natural part of human nature. 
  - Languages become no less useful or expressive with change through time. ALL SPOKEN LANGUAGES CHANGE.

- Kids need to study their language in school to learn to speak it properly –True or False?
  - This is a myth - **FALSE**
  - We do not need to learn how to use our language properly. Being surrounded by spoken/signed language is the only requirement for kids to learn their language fluently.
  - At school, we are taught a prestige variety of our language and taught prescriptive rules on how to use it in a specific context

- It is easier to learn Mandarin Chinese if your ancestry is Chinese – True or False
  - This is a myth - **FALSE**
  - The human brain has evolved to learn language – any language. 
  - At birth, babies can differentiate between ALL sounds of human language. By 6 months old, the brain starts to restructure to “hear” only the sounds in the ambient language(s).

- The definition of a linguist is someone who speaks a lot of languages –True or False?
  - This is a myth - **FALSE**
  - A polyglot is someone who speaks a lot of languages.
  - A linguist is someone who studies linguistics: the scientific study of the structure of languages (whether they speak them or not)

- What is the official language of the U.S.?
  - There is no official language in the U.S.
  - However, there is history that U.S. government discriminates other language

Linguistics is..

- Science. Scientific study of natural human language.
- **Empirical**: relying on or deriving from observation
  - Language as scientific data to be analyzed objectively.
- Study of language structure and language use = *grammar*
  - Not about *prescriptive* grammar
    - i.e. telling people what should or should not say
  - Linguistic is about descriptive grammar
    - describe and explain what people actually do.
- **Objective:** Study of language without judgement.



How long have humans had spoken language?

- 50,000 ~ 100,000 years

  

Origin of Language

- This topic is difficult to study, because there is little direct evidence.
- Scientists try to make inferences from other types of evidence, such as the fossil record, archaeology, language diversity, and other observations.



How long have there been writing systems?

- ~5,500 years

Writing systems are not language

- The development and use of writing is very different than that of spoken (or signal) languages.
- Linguistics focuses primarily on spoken (or signed) language.
