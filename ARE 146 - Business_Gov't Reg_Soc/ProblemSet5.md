##### Problem 1 Cleaning Up the Air

Assume that there are two electric power plants (firm 1 and firm 2) emitting sulfur dioxide, an air pollutant.  They can reduce emissions at the following total costs, where q1 is tons of emissions abatement by firm 1, and q2 is tons of abatement by firm 2:

$TAC_1 = \frac{1}{4}q_1^2$			$TAC_2 = \frac{1}{2}q_2^2$

Assume that unregulated emissions are 20 tons for each firm, for a total of 40 tons, where ùë• denotes emissions. That is in the absence of regulation, ùë•1 + ùë•2 = 40.

a. An environmental regulator must reduce total emissions of sulfur dioxide by 18 tons. Compute the cost-effective allocation of control responsibility; how many tons of emissions abatement must each firm achieve in order to minimize the total abatement costs?

- Begin by finding the marginal abatement cost for firm 1 and firm 2. 

  $MAC_1(q_1) = \frac{1}{2}q_1$

  $MAC_2(q_2) = q_2$

  Then set the marginal abatement costs equal

  $MAC_1(q_1) = MAC_2(q_2)$

  $\frac{1}{2}q_1 = q_2$

  $\frac12 q_1 = 18-q_1$

  $\frac32q_1 = 18$

  $q_1=12$		$q_2 = 18-12=6$



b. If the regulator chooses to meet her 18-ton reduction objective with an emissions tax, what per-unit charge should be imposed?

- $\tau = MAC_1(12) = MAC_2(6)$

  $\tau = \frac12(12) = 6$



c. How much government revenue will the tax system generate, if the tax is levied on all units of pollution? 

- Total revenues are simply emissions, times the tax per unit of emissions: 

  $TR = \tau*(x_1+x_2)$

  $TR = 6*(40-18) = \$132$



d. Please find the market (aggregate) marginal abatement cost function.

- For each MAC, solving for quantity  as a function of price.  

  $q_1(MAC) = 2*MAC$

  $q_2(MAC) = 1*MAC$

  Now aggregate, summing horizontally, to find the market quantity or abatement at any price

  $Q(MAC) = q_1(MAC) + q_2(MAC) = 3MAC,$ for $0\le MAC\le40$

  $MAC(Q) = \frac{1}{3}Q$



Let the total social benefit function for sulfur dioxide pollution abatement be: 

‚Äã	$TSB(Q) = 45\times Q-\frac73Q^2$

e. What is the efficient level of pollution control (call it Q*)?
