##### Problem 1 Economies of Scope and Scale 



##### Problem 2 Natural Monopolies and Pricing 

Consider a natural monopoly with total costs $C = 400+8Q$. Market demand is $𝑄 = 300−4𝑃$. Imagine the regulator implements a linear tariff for the good.  

a. If price is set to marginal cost, what are the monopolist’s output and profits? What is consumer surplus?

$P(Q) = 75-\frac{1}{4}Q$

- $MC = 8, if \space Price = MC, P = 8$

  $Q = 300-4(8) = 268$

  $\pi = TR-TC=PQ-TC = 268(8)-400-8(268)=-400$

  $CS = \frac{1}{2}(75-8)(268) = 8978$



b. If price equals average cost, what are the monopolist’s output and profits? What is the consumer surplus?  

- $P(Q) = 75-\frac{1}{4}Q$

  $AC = \frac{400+8Q}{Q}$

  $P(Q) = AC$

  $75-\frac{1}{4}Q=\frac{400+8Q}{Q}$

  $300Q-Q^2 = 1600+32Q$

  $Q^2-268Q+1600 = 0$

  $Q = 261.89$

  $P = 75-\frac{1}{4}(261.89) = 9.53$

  since $TR=TC$ Profit = 0

  $CS = \frac{1}{2}(75-9.53)(261.89) = 8573$

c. There is now two-part pricing. The monopolist sets price equal to the marginal cost and charges a fixed fee per customer. Assume that demand comes from 100 identical consumers. What is the participation fee if the regulator sets prices to maximize consumer surplus with the monopolist breaking even? 

- The profit to monopolies was -400 under MC Pricing. There are 100 consumers. So the fixed cost was 400/100 = 4

d. What participation fee would a profit-maximizing monopolist set?  

- Since price = MC and consumer surplus is 8978, and there are 100 consumers. A profit maximizing monopolist will extract all the consumer surplus for himself. He does this by charging a fixed fee of 89.78 to each consumer.  

##### Problem 3 Ramsey Pricing (VHV Chapter 12 Question 5) 

Assume that a water distribution monopoly serves two consumer types, industrial and residential. Let $P_I$ denote the price that industrial consumers pay for water, and $P_R$ denote the price that residential consumers pay for water. The demand for water by industrial is $Q_I(P_I) = 30-P_I$. The demand for water by residential consumers is $𝑄_𝑅(𝑃_𝑅)=24−𝑃_𝑅$. The only cost the monopoly incurs is a fixed cost of installing a water pipeline. The cost is $\$ 328$. Find the Ramsey prices.

- Ramsey's Rule: $\frac{P_i -MC_i}{P_i} = \frac{r}{e_i}$, and leads to TR = TC

  $\frac{P_i -MC_i}{P_i} = \frac{r}{\frac{Q_i-Q(MC_i)}{Q_i}*\frac{P_i}{P_i-MC_i}}$

  $\frac{Q_i-Q(MC_i)}{Q_i} = r$

  $\frac{Q_R-24}{Q_R} = r = \frac{Q_I-30}{Q_I}$

  $...$

  $Q_I = 1.25 Q_R$

  $TR = TC,\space TC = 328$

  $P_RQ_R + P_IQ_I = 328$

  $(24-Q_R)Q_R + (30-Q_I)Q_I = 328$

  $(24-Q_R)Q_R + (30-1.25Q_R)1.25Q_R = 328$

  $...$

  $Q_R = 16or8$, pick $Q_R = 16$ since larger quantity will lead to a higher total surplus

  $Q_I = 1.25*16 = 20$

  $P_R = 24-16 = 8$

  $P_I = 30-20 = 10$
