  - <u>1833</u>, **Hylaeosaurus** by Richard Owen 林龙
    - Initially, Buckland believed Megalosaurus was a giant lizard, Mantell believed Iguanodon was a giant iguana, and Owen believed Hylaeosaurus was a large, aquatic reptile. As more fossils were discovered, it became apparent that these creatures were not just giant lizards or aquatic reptiles, but belonged to a distinct group of creatures that we now know as dinosaurs.
