  Poisons and History - Trial and Error!

- Definition of Taxicology
  - The study of the adverse effects of chemicals, not the study of toxic chemicals

- Paracelsus "Bombastic" - the dose makes the poison
- Ramazzini (Italian Physician) - The father of occupational medicine. Wrote book Diseases of Workers 
  - Seminal book outlined the health hazards encountered by workers in 52 occupations. Such as miners, midwives, printers, weavers and potters.

- Rachel Carson - published Silent Spring in 1962
  - Describes health problems observed in wildlife such as egg shell thinning, deformites and population declines. Link these adverse effects to exposure to pesticides and other synthetic chemicals. 这本书（Silent Spring ）列举了各地滥用杀虫剂所造成的种种危害，促使公众普遍关注[农药](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/農藥)与[环境污染](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/环境污染)。《寂静的春天》促使美国于1972年禁止将[DDT](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDT)用于农业上。
- 1969: Cuyahoga River ON FIRE in Cleveland Ohio
  - polluting rivers with chemical pollution caused river fire.
  - Consequence: 
    - International new coverage. 
    - Creation of the US Environmental protection agency. 
    - Passing of the Clean Water Act (1972): sets water pollution limits. Gave EPA power to fine industry for violating limits. Improved sewage treatment.



What Fields Use Toxicology

- Environmental:
  - Determine where the chemicals go in an ecosystem
  - Develop detection methods in soil, water, plants and animals
  - Monitor exposure in living things of ecosystems
  - Chemical effects on health of plants, animals & ecosystems.
- Biomedical researchers:
  - Health effects of exposure
  - Mechanisms of exposure adversity
    - At all levels of biological organization: physiology to signaling 
  - Understanding biological responses through prototypical toxic chemical
  - Development of antidotes & treatments for exposures

- Clinical/doctors (MDs) in the office:
  - Use of antidotes & treatments (poison control)
  - Recognition of patients’ exposure
  - Monitor side effects of prescriptions
  - Identify chemical causes of disease (CDC)
- Public Health:
  - Recognize and identify hazards
  - Develop detection methods in human tissues
  - Monitor human exposure in groups of people
  - Develop exposure standards
  - Develop clean-up plans

- Forensic toxicologists:
  - Develop detection methods in human tissues and materials near to humans
  - Measure trace chemical amounts in old, decaying, and dirty materials
  - Develop and defend measurements
- Expert consultants for lawyers:
  - Review plaintiff histories
  - Evaluate scientific literature
  - Write literature summaries
  - Provide testimony
    - Quality of exposure measures
    - Whether its more likely than not that exposure caused disease
